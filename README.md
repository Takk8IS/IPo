# IPo (IP Optimization)

## About the Project

This Python script was developed to help obtain and display detailed information about IP addresses, whether for your own IP, a network IP, or a specific website. It uses the `ipapi.co` API to retrieve information and the `Rich` library to display it clearly and organisedly.

## Features

The code consists of several functions to fetch and display IP information:

1. `get_ip_info`: Fetches IP information from the `ipapi.co` API.
2. `get_site_ip_info`: Resolves the IP address of a website and fetches detailed information about it.
3. `display_ip_info`: Displays the IP information in a table using the `Rich` library.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the Python script `ipo.py` in a directory of your choice.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script by typing `python ipo.py` in the terminal.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired option:
    - 1 for local IP information.
    - 2 for network IP information.
    - 3 for specific website IP information.
6. Detailed information about the IP will be displayed in a table in the terminal.
